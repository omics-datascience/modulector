# Modulector Backend

Modulector is a performing open platform that provides information about miRNAs and genes based on a compilation of information from different databases. It offers data about:

- miRNA interactions
- miRNA-target interactions
- Diseases
- Drugs
- miRNA aliases
- Genes aliases

## Usage

All services are available through a web API accessible from a browser or any other web client. In addition to the information provided, sorting, filtering, searching and paging functions are also available. How to use these functions is explained below:


### General

All functions are used as a parameter in the URL. So if you want to access `http://modulector.org/service/` by sending parameters to it, just add the following suffix to the end of the URL: `?parameter1=value&parameter2=value&parameter3=value`. The `?` indicates that the parameter section begins, these will be of the form `parameterName=parameterValue` and are separated, in case you need to send more than one, by a `&`.


### Sorting

In order to sort you must specify the parameter `ordering=fieldToSort`, if you want to sort descending you must add a `-` before the field name. You can specify several fields to sort separated by *commas*.

For example, if you want to consume the [miRNA interactions](#mirna-interactions) service by sorting by `score` descendingly and by `gene` ascendingly you can access the URL:

`http://modulector.org/mirna-interactions/?ordering=-score,gene`


### Filters

To filter it is enough to specify the field and the value by which you want to filter. For example, if you want to consume the [miRNA aliases](#mirna-aliases) service keeping only the aliases of `MIMAT0000062` you could access the following resource:

`http://modulector.org/mirna-aliases/?mirbase_accession_id=MIMAT0000062`


### Search

The search is done on the basis of a single parameter called `search` which must contain the value to be searched for. Unlike the filter, the search can be performed on multiple fields at once and is performed by *containing* the search term in the field and is case insensitive (while the filter is by exact value). The fields considered in the search are fixed and will be specified for each service later. For example, the [miRNA interactions](#mirna-interactions) service allows a search by the `gene` field, then the following query could be performed:

`http://modulector.org/mirna-aliases/?mirna=hsa-miR-577&search=FO`


### Pagination

Some services can return so many items that paginated responses were chosen, so that they are efficient queries of few items and can be traversed through parameterizable pages. There are two parameters that can be specified to handle pagination:

- `page`: allows you to specify the current page. If not specified, the default value `1` is used.
- page_size`: number of elements to return per page. If not specified, the default value `10` is used. The value cannot be greater than `1000`.


### Combining functions

All of the above parameters can be used together! For example, if we wanted to consume the [diseases](#diseases) service by sorting ascending by disease, performing a disease search and keeping only the first 3 items, we could perform the following query (the order of the parameters **does not matter**):

`http://modulector.org/diseases/?ordering=disease&search=leukemia&page_size=3`

**It will be indicated for each service which fields are available for filtering, sorting and/or searching**.
